### Comments

Make your code self-documenting!  
Mark each section as seen in the rest of the files.

### Functions

Use trailing return type.

### Class Scope Ordering

Declare everything that is public first!  
The order within public/protected/private parts is the following:

1. Type Aliases
2. Nested Classes
3. Friend Classes
4. Static Variables
5. Variables
6. Static Methods
7. Constructors / Destructors
8. Operators
9. Methods

Declare friend classes as private!

### Other

- Don't make class fields protected. Make a protected getter/setter instead.
