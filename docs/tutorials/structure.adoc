= Engine structure

The engine's code is structured around the following modules:

* app - the entry point of the program
* modules - the building blocks of the engine
* plugins - plugins for extending the app builder
* addons - addons for extending the app
* utility - basic helper functionalities
* config - configuration files for third-party

Each module has its own namespace (corresponding to the name of the module) and submodules.
