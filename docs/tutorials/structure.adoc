= Engine structure

The engine's code is structured around the following modules:

* prelude - frequently used functionality when initiating the library
* modules - the building blocks of the engine
* utility - basic helper functionalities
* config - configuration files for third-party

Each module (except prelude) has its own namespace corresponding to the name of the module and submodules.
