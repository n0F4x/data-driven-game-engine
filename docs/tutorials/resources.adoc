= Resource management

Resources (unlike assets) are the global variables of your app.
They are designed to be initialized before startup and easily accessible by systems.

[,c++]
----
auto app =
    app::create()
        .plug_in(plugins::resources)
        .insert_resource(MyResource{})
        .build();

MyResource& my_resource = app.resource_manager.get<MyResource>();
----

== Dependency injection

Resources can be created from other resources.
In order to access another *previously* initialized resource, you should inject your resource using a function.

[,c++]
----
app::create()
   .plug_in(plugins::resources)
   .insert_resource(Dependee{})
   .inject_resource([](Dependee& dependee) { return Dependant{ dependee }; })
   .build();
----

Injection functions are called from the build method.

[NOTE]
====
The injection function should only take resources as its parameters.
