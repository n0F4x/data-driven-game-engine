= Scheduling

The base of an application is the scheduler, which is responsible for running the different systems.

[,c++]
."Hello World!" using the scheduler
----
ddge::app::create()
    .plug_in(ddge::plugins::Scheduler{})
    .run([] { std::println("Hello World!"); });
----

We can also describe more complicated logic using scheduling primitives.

[,c++]
----
auto say_hello() -> void {
    std::println("Hello World!");
}

auto say_hi() -> void {
    std::println("Hi! ðŸ‘‹");
}

ddge::app::create()
    .plug_in(ddge::plugins::Scheduler{})
    .run(
        ddge::exec::start_as(say_hello)
            .then(say_hi)
    );

== Scheduling primitives

.Core scheduling primitives
* `+start_as+` - begins a schedule that can be chained using `+.then()+`

* `+in_parallel+` - puts the given tasks in a group +
Tasks within the group may run in parallel.

* `+group+` - puts the given tasks in a group +
Tasks within the group that don't share conflicting parameters may run in parallel.

With these, one may describe any form of schedule.
There are also a lot more primitives that serve some sort of logic, but they are not essential.

== Accessors

Tasks may take accessors as parameters.
Accessors come in all sorts of shapes.
Here are a few examples:

* `+Resource<Resource>+` - reference to a resource
* `+Registry+` - reference to the registry
* `+State<State>+` - reference to a state

Accessors are stored with their associated task.
Most accessors store only a reference, so it is fine to take them by value; however, a few of them (like `+Query+`) are more complicated and should be taken by reference.

.Example of a more complicated schedule
----
namespace sch = ddge::schedule;

auto schedule =
    sch::start_as(initialize_app)
        .then(
            sch::loop_until(
                sch::group(
                    process_events,
                    update,
                    render
                ),
                game_is_running
            )
        )
        .then(shut_down);
----

Where `+game_is_running+` may be defined as +

[,c++]
----
using namespace ddge::exec::accessors::resources;

auto game_is_running(Resource<Window> window) -> bool
{
    return window->is_open();
}
